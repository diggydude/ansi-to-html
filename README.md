# ansi-to-html
This is an experimental CP437-to-HTML (ANSI art) renderer in PHP

`sample.ans` is the sample ANSI art file I'm testing with. It's the cover page of BlockTronics' 2019 calendar.

`sample.html` is the faulty output I'm getting.

`correct_output.html` is the desired output as generated by the reference implementation, ANSIFilter.

I think the problem is one of the following:

* Keeping incorrect count of printable characters on lines that wrap at the righthand boundary.

* Rejecting too many or too few non-printable characters in the HTML entity conversion. For example, allowing character 127 (delete) seems to yield better results than rejecting it.

* There may be cursor movement commands in the sample input that I'm not seeing.

If anyone has ideas about how to fix it, please contact me at therealdiggydude@gmail.com. Thanks!
