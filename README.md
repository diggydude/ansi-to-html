# ansi-to-html
This is an experimental CP437-to-HTML (ANSI art) renderer in PHP

`sample.ans` is the sample ANSI art file I'm testing with. It's the cover page of BlockTronics' 2019 calendar.

`sample.html` is the faulty output I'm getting.

`correct_output.html` is the desired output as generated by the reference implementation, ansifilter.

I think the problem is one of the following:

* Keeping incorrect count of printable characters on lines that wrap at the righthand boundary.

* Rejecting too many or too few non-printable characters in the HTML entity conversion. For example, allowing character 127 (delete) seems to yield better results than rejecting it.

If anyone has ideas about how to fix it, please contact me at therealdiggydude@gmail.com. Thanks!
